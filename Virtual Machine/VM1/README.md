## To execute vm_translator.py:

Have vm_translator.py and your vm file in the same folder/directory

Then type Python vm_translator.py [filename].vm into the command line, make sure you are in Python 3.8.8 or higher. Then once it works it should create a new file called [filename].asm. Use the Assembler.sh to convert the .asm file to a .hack file. Run the .hack file on the CPUEmulator.sh to verify functionality.

You can also use my own assembler and CPU that I designed.
